1459643533770596352 2021-11-13 22:05:11 +0000 <MananMathur21> I was concerned about Purdue this week against Ohio State, but boy they are unraveling at speed of light today. #OhioState vs #Purdue
1459643531966959620 2021-11-13 22:05:11 +0000 <r_page0726> Is this shock or awe or both? #Purdue #OhioState
1459643405785395203 2021-11-13 22:04:41 +0000 <DisplacedSports> Turns out Vegas did know something. #OhioState #Purdue
1459643341436502023 2021-11-13 22:04:26 +0000 <vitti09> Man #Purdue has been able to move the ball and score (when not fumbling). But it doesn't matter when the other team is playing against air.

1459643075123417088 2021-11-13 22:03:22 +0000 <AlanKarpick> Ok, Ok, I don't like to report on these type of stats...but in case you are wondering, the most points given up in a first half by #Purdue is 56 in against Auburn in the 2018 bowl game in Nashville.
1459643021776101381 2021-11-13 22:03:09 +0000 <Nicc2Nice> OH St averaging 15 yards per carry in the first half ü•≤ Purdue‚Äôs defense never got off the bus! #OhioState #Purdue #CollegeFootball
1459642986325843972 2021-11-13 22:03:01 +0000 <JollyGood_Fella> Damn, #Purdue. It was all good just a week ago. #OSUvsPUR
1459642951072632838 2021-11-13 22:02:53 +0000 <RichNye13> @brianneubert #Purdue isn‚Äôt seeing that talent. It‚Äôs flying by them too fast.

1459642931036438529 2021-11-13 22:02:48 +0000 <craigswearingen> Brohm will be asked at halftime ‚Äúwhat they need to do better in the second half?‚Äù   His answer better be: ‚ÄúEverything‚Äù.   #Purdue #BoilerUp #OSUvsPUR #Buckeyes
1459642912183144449 2021-11-13 22:02:43 +0000 <jrat33> If #purdue hurries, they can get on the road and beat the traffic. #PURvsOSU
1459642895347167232 2021-11-13 22:02:39 +0000 <FunnelFiasco> If #Purdue's first stringers play a down in the second half, Brohm should be fired on the spot.
1459642840149991431 2021-11-13 22:02:26 +0000 <noahzark93> The head coach of #purdue has a losing record after being there for 5 years. Maybe it‚Äôs time to move on? #purduevsohiostate
1459642659702726656 2021-11-13 22:01:43 +0000 <chrisod> On the bright side, we won't have to hear #Spoilermakers again this season. This is not what they mean by #GoUglyEarly  #Purdue

1459642160471367685 2021-11-13 21:59:44 +0000 <Columbus_Wired> #Purdue may be losing by 3 TDs but QB Aidan O'Connell is having a game: 20-of-24 passing for 83%, 180 yds and 2 TDs. #OSUvsPurdue
1459641903595630608 2021-11-13 21:58:43 +0000 <cubscoltsfan> We really really need a turnover. #Purdue
1459641780316606465 2021-11-13 21:58:13 +0000 <Craig83299087> #Purdue has been shooting themselves in the feet
1459641294012264453 2021-11-13 21:56:17 +0000 <MikeHaverland> @Dan_Hope #Buckeyes D took a nap on that series. They better wake up quick. #Purdue can come back in a hurry
